# Inquisitor-2.0
Discord Bot written in Python
Performs simple operations like streaming music from youtube videos. More planned in the future including:
- Challenging another user to a game of chess
- Administrative commands
- Voice commands?

Make sure to use virtualenv and install the requirements:

Python 3.4-3.6 required (Not 3.7)

    virtualenv inquisitor
    pip install -r requirements.txt

If you want to run multiple bots at the same time... too bad. The current version of the Discord Python API wrapper is bugged and the issue has been reported.
